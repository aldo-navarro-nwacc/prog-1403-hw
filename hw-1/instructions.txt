Challenge:
Your mission for this project is to accept two dates from the user, 
and to calculate the number of weekends between those two dates.
Here, we will define a weekend as a Saturday & Sunday, Saturday only, or Sunday only.
The beginning and ending dates must be included in the determination.

Rules:
1. Print these three lines of text on the console
    a. "HW1 - Counting Weekends"
    b. "Solution by [name]
    c. A blank line

2. Getting two dates from the user - a start date and an end time. 
Both dates must be entered from the console and be in one of the following formats:
    a. m/d/y - where month and day values may be 1 or 2 digits and the year may be 2 or 4 digits. 
    a-i. A 2-digit year must be interpreted as occuring within the 21st century.
    b. m/d - where the year is assumed to be 2025. Same rules for month and day as in 1 above.
    c. y-m-d - where the values for month, day, and year must follow the same rules as in 1 above.

3. Both dates must fall within the years 1800 - 2200 inclusive and must be valid dates (no 02/31)

4. A weekend is defined as a Saturday, a Sunday, or both.

5. Report the following results in an easy-to-read format on the console for each set of dates entered by the user:
    a. The number of full Saturday-Sunday weekends between the dates
    b. The number of Saturday-only weekends between the dates
    c. The number of Sunday-only weekends between the dates

6. Allow the user to repeat the process of entering pairs of dates and getting the weekend counts forever

7. Print "HW1 Complete" in the console
